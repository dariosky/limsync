"""Sanitize uv.lock so it matches what would be produced without a custom UV_DEFAULT_INDEX.

Current goals:
- Ensure registry lines read: source = { registry = "https://pypi.org/simple" }
- Ensure distribution (sdist / wheel) URLs point to https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/...
- Convert any URLs that still reference the custom index host (optionally with /simple) to the
  canonical PyPI hosts, without introducing path duplication like /packages/packages/.
- Remove [[tool.uv.index]] blocks from pyproject.toml (unchanged logic).

We purposefully avoid a blanket host replacement to prevent corrupting the structure of
wheel/sdist paths and to keep the two canonical hosts distinct: pypi.org (index) and
files.pythonhosted.org (distributions).
